    During my professional tenure, I held the position of Senior Software Engineer at Persistent Systems. Here, I played a pivotal role in crafting a media dashboard reminiscent of platforms like Netflix and Amazon. This involved extensive involvement in requirement elicitation and client interactions. Furthermore, I acquired practical insights through an internship at Zestl Software Pvt. Ltd., where my focus was on machine learning applications and proficient data wrangling techniques.
